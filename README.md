# Home Automation with ESP32/ESP8266 and Blynk App

This repository contains code and instructions for setting up home automation using the ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller and the Blynk app. You can control various appliances, lights, and sensors through your smartphone with the Blynk interface.

## Introduction

This project allows you to control your home automation devices remotely using the Blynk app. The ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontrollers will be used to interface with sensors and actuators such as relays, switches, and lights.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. **ESP32 or ESP8266 board**
2. **Blynk app installed on your smartphone (available on iOS and Android)**
3. **Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for programming the board**
4. **Wi-Fi network to connect your ESP32/ESP8266 device**

### Libraries Required

- `Blynk` â€“ to communicate with the Blynk app.
- `ESP32` or `ESP8266` board support in the Arduino IDE.

You can install the necessary libraries and board definitions from the Arduino Library Manager.

## Setting Up the Blynk App

1. Download and install the **Blynk app** from the App Store or Google Play.
2. Create a new project in the app:
   - Select your hardware (ESP32 or ESP8266).
   - Choose a connection type (Wi-Fi).
   - You will receive an **auth token** on your email. This token is essential for connecting your device to the app.
3. Add widgets in the Blynk app for controlling your home automation system (e.g., buttons for controlling relays, sliders for dimming lights).

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 or ESP8266 board
- Relay module (for controlling high-voltage devices)
- Push buttons or switches (optional, for manual control)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply for the ESP board and peripherals

## Wiring Diagram

Here is a basic wiring setup for controlling a relay module using the ESP32/ESP8266:

- **VCC** of the relay to **5V** (or 3.3V depending on your relay module) of the ESP board
- **GND** of the relay to **GND** of the ESP board
- **IN1** of the relay to **GPIO Pin X** (choose the GPIO pin you want to control with Blynk)
- **Common** (COM) and **NO** (Normally Open) of the relay to control an appliance or light

For additional sensors or actuators, you can refer to their datasheets for wiring instructions.

## Programming the ESP32/ESP8266

### Step 1: Install Board Definitions in Arduino IDE

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **File > Preferences**, and in the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field, add:
   - For ESP32: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`
   - For ESP8266: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
3. Go to **Tools > Board > Board Manager**, and search for **ESP32** or **ESP8266** and install the respective package.

### Step 2: Install the Blynk Library

1. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
2. Search for **Blynk** and install the latest version.

### Step 3: Enter Your Blynk Auth Token

1. Open the `blynk_esp32_automation.ino` file (or create your own sketch).
2. Replace `your_auth_token` with the token you received from the Blynk app.
3. Specify your Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password).
